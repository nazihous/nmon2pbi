# NMON to NDJSON Converter ... FOR POWERBI/EXCEL

This repository contains a Python script that processes `.nmon` filesÂ  into structured NDJSON (Newline-Delimited JSON) files for further analysis in POWERBI.
![alt text](https://github.com/nazihous/nmon2pbi/blob/main/capture5.jpg?raw=true)

## Features

- Parses `.nmon` files into various categories: `CPU`, `Memory`, `Disk`, `Network`, `LPAR`, and more.
- Outputs structured NDJSON files in categorized subdirectories.
- Supports multiprocessing for faster processing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required libraries: `argparse`, `json`, `os`, `multiprocessing`, `re`, `hashlib`

## Usage

Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python nmon2ndjson.py  --input_dir <path_to_nmon_files> --output_dir <output_path> --processes <num_processes>
```

### Example

```bash
python nmon2ndjson.py --input_dir ./nmon_folder --output_dir ./json_folder --processes 4
```

### Arguments

- `--input_dir`: Directory containing `.nmon` files.
- `--output_dir`: Directory where NDJSON files will be saved.
- `--processes`: (Optional) Number of processes for parallel execution.

## Output Structure

The script creates subdirectories under the specified output directory:

- `all/`: Combined CPU, memory, and other data by timestamp.
- `top/`: Records the utilization statistics of top process. (-t)
- `fc/`: Records the FC I/O statistics. This statistic is present in every iteration and for every fibre interface.
- `vg/`: Records volume group statistics. Each metric is recorded for all volume groups that are present on the LPAR.
- `net/`: Records the network I/O statistics. This statistic is present in every iteration and for every network interface.
- `jfs/`: Records the Journaled File System (JFS) statistics. The proc file system is not recorded because it is a pseudo file system. 
- `disk/`: Records I/O statistics for each disk. This statistics is recorded by default. For every disk , the same set of tags on DISK* are repeated.
- `uargs/`: Records the process argument details. You can use the -T option to enable these recording details. The -T option automatically enables the -t option that records top process statistics. (-T)

## How It Works

1. **Parse \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*****`.nmon`**: The script reads `.nmon` files and extracts data.
2. **Build NDJSON**: It processes data into various categories.
3. **Save Files**: Writes structured NDJSON to the respective directories.

## Power BI Integration ( DAX & DATA MODELING)
![alt text](https://github.com/nazihous/nmon2pbi/blob/main/capture3.jpg?raw=true)

To integrate the processed data into Power BI, you can use the following DAX queries:

### Timestamp Table

```DAX
TimestampTable = 
SUMMARIZE(
    FILTER('all', NOT(ISBLANK('all'[@timestamp]))),
    'all'[@timestamp],
    "Hour", HOUR('all'[@timestamp]),
    "Minute", MINUTE('all'[@timestamp])
)
```

### Frame and Node Table

```DAX
FrameNodeTable = DISTINCT(SELECTCOLUMNS('all',"Frame",[lpar_info.Frame],"Node",[lpar_info.Node]))
```

These DAX formulas are designed to create relationships in the Power BI data model. By using the `TimestampTable` and `FrameNodeTable`, you can establish a one-to-all relationship with the main data tables . This enables filtering and selection based on timestamps, frames, and nodes across all metrics, providing a seamless experience for data exploration and analysis.

### UARGS and TOP Relationship

If you're familiar with NMON, this script enables you to map UARGS (-T for nmon recording) data (collected once) to TOP data using a special primary/secondary key. This lets you display information like PID, command, and %CPU from TOP, alongside the corresponding full command, user, and group from UARGS.
you can drill down into specific time intervals to identify processes causing CPU spikes based on PID, PPID, full command, command, or user.
- Each `UARGSID` is derived from a combination of `PID`, timestamp, and file-specific details, ensuring uniqueness.
- This allows you to connect and filter the `TOP` table based on user arguments (`UARGS`)
